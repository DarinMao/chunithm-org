# Rating Calculator

I created a [Chunithm Rating Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TT3-89PqcTvyL_nMbnGxL2q5bg5pLtHiKg_qStSJ88M/edit?usp=sharing) for players that are interested in checking what their rating is or how far they need to go to reach specific rating milestones. Simply input your top 30 charts and your top 10 charts in your recents folder and the calculator will determine your current rating. It also allows you to input hypothetical values for goal-setting.

A somewhat popular method for score tracking is [Kamaitachi](https://kamai.tachi.ac), a web service where scores can be imported from a number of sources and then displayed in helpful ways.

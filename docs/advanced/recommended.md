# Recommended Charts

## Codex Quick Farming Guide / Questline Task Charts

As this resource has matured, the [**Quick Farming Guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xP1huTSA-XWKZaDfmyNh-viRbUE777d2Rg54j5-2VAU/edit?gid=1862648347#gid=1862648347) in the [Chunithm Chart Codex](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xP1huTSA-XWKZaDfmyNh-viRbUE777d2Rg54j5-2VAU/edit?gid=86796591#gid=86796591) has become the most up-to-date set of recommended charts for rating grind across a broad range of difficulties. The Codex contains all of the charts in the game sorted by level, accompanied by some quick notes so someone reading through it can understand and prepare for some of the main gimmicks in the chart. It contains my personal opinions on charts, as well as some opinions from other Chunithm players. If you feel strongly about a particular chart, feel free to leave a comment on the chart in question!

On the other hand, I will point to the Task Charts in the [**Kamaitachi Chunithm Questline Tracker**](https://chunithm.org/quests) for a series of challenging charts that will help players develop a more rounded skillset. These are also recommended by me, although in a different sense than the farming charts above.

## Chunirec BEST 枠統計 (Best Frame Statistics)

[Chunirec](https://chunirec.net/) is an online service that sources player data from the official JP chunithm-net and can scrape player scores for those signed up for the service.

One of their particularly useful tools is the "[**BEST 枠統計**](https://chunirec.net/stat/best?rc=160&region=jp2)" (EN: BEST Frame Statistics). This tool allows users to specify a **target rating** (ranging from 15.0 to 17.6 in increments of 0.1) and the website will display a list of the charts that are the **most common** among players who have achieved that rating alongside additional details like chart constant and the average score/rank. This service is great as you can use it to determine charts to target as you progress and gain rating from gold to high rainbow.

Note: as this is a JP tool, charts now reflect VERSE constants.

Additionally, if you have registered for a chunirec account, the difference between your obtained scores and the average score will be displayed.

Note that the list will be populated with charts up to the current official version in JP (currently chunithm LUMINOUS).

## SEGA Top 30 (**NEW**)

In the official [SEGA broadcast announcing Chunithm **NEW+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYRvHjgA69I&t=1200s), the dev team released a list of 30 charts that were the most commonly played charts across all players that were in their best 30 when they hit rainbow. Most of the charts in this list are very common recommendations for players looking to hit the rainbow rating threshold, although I would personally not recommend some of them (_e.g. Kattobi KEIKYU Rider, VERTeX_). In order from most used to least used, those charts are:

| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POPS & ANIME   | **P&A**  | Includes J-pop, J-rock, and a lot of anime opening and ending songs.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| niconico       | **nico** | Mostly vocaloid or utaite songs. Hatsune Miku, GUMI, KAFU, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 東方 Project   | **東方** | Doujin music from the Touhou series. Spans a lot of genres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| VARIETY        | **VAR**  | Stuff that doesn't really fit into the other genres, but generally speaking this includes **game music** (like stuff from Sonic), **rhythm game music** (such as collaborations with other arcade/console rhythm games) and **BMS** (such as osu! original FREEDOM DiVE↓ :slight_smile:). |
| イロドリミドリ | **イロ** | Translated to "Irodori Midori" in English, these songs comprise songs that are sung by Chunithm original characters that belong to the Irodori Midori "group". Essentially, they are Chunithm's attempt to replicate K-ON or similar anime high school girl bands.            |
| ゲキマイ       | **撃舞** | Original songs from Sega's other rhythm games, Maimai and Ongeki (as in, songs that were made specifically for those games. Things that fit into the other genres that happen to be in those games will not be in this category.)                                             |
| ORIGINAL       | **ORI**  | Songs original to Chunithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The categories are coloured to match the sorting on the wiki and the chart compendium.

## Extra notes on song sorting

- New songs that are added to the P&A, niconico, and 東方 Project folders are added right to left in order of release (new songs will be on the far left).
- The VARIETY folder generally follows a left to right release order sorting but has some weird exceptions that don't seem to follow any pattern.
  - Bemani > Paca Paca Passion > rhythm games > BMS > non rhythm games (starting with SEGA franchises)
- New songs added to イロドリミドリ act as a microcosm of the overall Chunithm song sorting system, with covers of songs being placed in category order after the irodori originals, which are otherwise added left to right in order of release.
- For the ゲキマイ folder, maimai songs are in the first half and ongeki songs are in the second half, they then both follow a left to right song addition order.
- Original songs are the most straightforward, and are added left to right chronologically (except for some exceptions at the very start of the folder).

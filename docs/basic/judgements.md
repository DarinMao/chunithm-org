# Judgement

There are 4 different note judgements in Chunithm.
From best to worst, they are: **Justice Critical**, **Justice**, **Attack**, and **Miss**.

Judgements are weighted according to the following table:

| Justice Critical | Justice  | Attack  |  Miss  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
|     **101%**     | **100%** | **50%** | **0%** |

The score calculation is performed by multiplying all judgements by the proportion of notes hit, dividing the sum by the note count, and multiplying by 10,000 to receive a score out of a **theoretical maximum of 1,010,000**.

Chart clears that have no misses (any number of attacks, other judgements) are awarded a **FULL COMBO** designation.
Chart clears that have no misses and no attacks are awarded an **ALL JUSTICE** designation.

# Matching

Chunithm allows you to play charts simultaneously with cab-to-cab matching capability. Ensure that the matching option is set to "Yes" in settings, then you can create a room by selecting a chart and then scrolling left to the Matching option. This will open a lobby that other players can join by going to the "Cabinet-to-cabinet play" tab in song select. There is a toggle for indicating whether you are only opening a room for friends or are ok with anyone joining, but this does not actually prevent people from joining your room.

Chunithm cabinets can only match others in the same matching group (e.g. Matching group "A" or "B").

During matching play, the center of the playfield will be occupied by the **Chain** indicator, which is a running combo count for all players participating. This will be reset to 0 when any participating players miss a note.

**LUMINOUS+:** Chain can now be toggled off in game settings.

    In **International** region, cab-to-cab matching rewards you with an additional **4th song** for your set (matching only needs to be played once). You can check if this option is enabled by scrolling to the matching tab or a popup will be present on the title screen. Don't hesitate to ask players around you to match for an extra track\!

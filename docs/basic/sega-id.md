# SEGA ID

Even though it is not necessary to have a SEGA ID to play the game,
creating one gives you access to things like:

- Transferring your data to another card if card is lost or damaged
- Viewing scores
- Customizing settings and cosmetics 

... and many more. 

While you can use social media login (X/Twitter and Facebook) for CHUNITHM
International, the Japanese version strictly requires a SEGA ID.

## Registering a SEGA ID

Go to the [SEGA ID registration page](https://gw.sega.jp/gateway/create/).

### Submitting an email address
On the first page, enter a valid email address (メールアドレス) in the white input
area and then click the green button below to submit your email address.

### Confirm your information

After you submitted your information, you are given a last check to verify that the

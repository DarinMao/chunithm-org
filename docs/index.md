## Intro
Hi! I'm Codex, a Canadian :flag_ca: Chunithm player. I've been playing Chunithm actively since 2021 and wanted to share some of my knowledge and experience with the wider English-speaking rhythm game community. I have also participated and placed in the podium for the following North American Chunithm tournaments: [Boston INNOVATED \-\[i1\]-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rF0fIZZDk), [CHQ Arcade Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9dRyY-lnZo), and [Zenith Arcade Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33eT3CksmLc).

Chunithm is a rhythm-based arcade game that feels intuitive and easy to pick up, which is one of its biggest strengths as an arcade game. Some aspects of the game are not as easy to pick up on when starting, so I wanted to create a guide that will hopefully help new players get oriented and familiar players deepen their understanding of the game.

Keep an eye out for the icon below for _Mitsuyoshi Tips_, which serve to highlight cool hidden or lesser-known mechanics in the game. They are also listed below for convenience.

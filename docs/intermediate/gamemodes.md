# Other Game Modes

## Class Certification/Course Mode

Course mode is a mode where you play three predetermined or random charts in a row with a restriction on how much you can mess up. For example, a course may give you 100 "life", but each attack will deduct 1 life and each miss will deduct 2 life. Different courses will have different judgements and conditions. You pass the course by making it to the end and staying alive, upon which a **class badge** of the corresponding difficulty is added to your player card.

Courses are split up into difficulty by classes, ranging from I (one) to V (five) with the addition of class INF. These courses increase in difficulty, with class V courses demanding you to survive through a combination of 13+ and 14 charts (brutal). By clearing **all** courses within a difficulty, you will receive a **class banner/emblem**, which will appear behind your class badge.

**PARADISE LOST**: course mode is accessed at the **beginning** of the set, right after login. You must commit to playing a full course or instead choosing a map and beginning standard play.

**NEW**: course mode is accessed **within song select**. However, it is only accessible before the first song is played and will be greyed out on track 2 and beyond.

## World's End

World's End charts are an entirely separate set of charts that have wacky mechanics, such as making all of the notes tiny, making all of the patterns way more dense, adding in damage notes, and more. The difficulty number is replaced with a specific Japanese kanji character and a number of stars from 1-5 to distinguish what kind of gimmick will feature in the chart. They do not affect your rating and are a "for fun" mode, although some of them make an appearance in the INF class courses.

World’s End charts require a **ticket** to play.

A list of World's End Markings are given below:

| 割                               | Division      | Usually the same as normal charts but all the notes are split into the smallest possible notes while retaining the original size.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 半                               | Half          | All notes are half the width and the chart only takes up the middle two fourths of the playing field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 狂                               | Insanity      | Charts are very hard with lots of notes, often very tiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 跳                               | Hop           | Most, if not all of the notes in these charts are AIR notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 翔                               | Soar          | Similar to "Hop", but with AIR-HOLD and AIR-SLIDEs throughout the chart. Can be considered a derivative type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 両                               | Dual          | A derivative of 半, where the chart is split down the middle and each side is treated as its own chart. If played normally, players may find themselves running out of fingers or hands. Can be played by two players cooperatively, one taking each half of the slider. The difficulty of each side is sometimes suggested in NOTES DESIGNER. |

Avoiding Game \- a mixture of 避 (Evasion) and 敷 (Cover), where you must avoid damage notes while performing and endless HOLD/SLIDE (think Touhou and bullet hell games), and 2\. Anything else that does not fall into any other category.                                                                            |

## Online Battle

Online Battle (全国対戦) was introduced in **NEW**, and is a matchmaking mode where up to 4 players are placed in lobbies against other players of similar skill level and compete against each other across 4 songs; each player picks their own chart.

Winning in online battle results in your "Battle Rank" increasing, which is shown on your nameplate and can also impact other cosmetic items like titles. Online Battle is only implemented in the JP server.

## Unlock Challenge

VERSE: Unlock Challenges are a form of task track where players must clear charts while maintaining a limited lifebar. As soon as the lifebar falls to zero, the attempt immediately ends and the player is sent to the score screen. Clearing the unlock challenge unlocks the chart for normal play.

Non-justice-critical judgements will all decrease the lifebar by varying amounts, and the clear requirements are relaxed at various points in time after the unlock challenge is introduced.

| Judgement        | Penalty  |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Justice          | -1 life  |
| Attack           | -2 life  |
| Miss             | -5 life  |

The lifebar starts at 10 life, then proceeds to 50 life and finally 150 life.

By default, an unlock challenge can only be attempted once per credit, and additional tries can be given by using various tickets.

## Linked VERSE

X-VERSE: Linked VERSE is Chunithm's special 10 year anniversary "throwback" system present in X-VERSE and X-VERSE-X. Mechanically, it introduces a hidden "sequel song" to a boss chart from each prior themed version of the game, and players must fulfill hidden unlock conditions followed by a challenge run to unlock these songs.

Upon completion of the version named maps (ep. ORIGIN/AIR/STAR etc.), a Gate will appear in the Linked VERSE folder. Players must also complete hidden objectives to receive an Access Card, which will then allow players to attempt to unlock the attached song.

For details on unlock conditions and tips to optimize unlocking Linked VERSE, check out the [Chunithm Linked VERSE Unlock Guide spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j7kmCR0-R5W3uivwkw-6A_eUCXttnJLnkTO0Qf7dya0/edit?usp=sharing)!
